/**
 * You should implement from zero a data structure that acts as an ArrayList.
 * We have a default capacity of {@link MyImplementedList#DEFAULT_CAPACITY} elements of type <code>E</code>.
 * We have a {@link MyImplementedList#size} property that stores the number of elements of type <code>E</code> from the data structure.
 * We have an array property, {@link MyImplementedList#elementData}, that keeps the elements from the data structure.
 * We have a {@link MyImplementedList#LOAD_FACTOR} property that specify the maximum accepted load of the data structure.
 * We have a {@link MyImplementedList#INCREASE_SIZE_FACTOR} property to use it when we must increase the capacity of the data structure.
 * We have a {@link MyImplementedList#capacityAfterExtending} property to use it to retain the new capacity after increasing it.
 * <p>
 * Starting with this properties we must implement a data structure that acts ~ as an ArrayList for some objects of type <code>E</code>.
 * <p>
 * TODO if you need to throw some exceptions YOU MUST create them!
 * TODO if you get some warning from the compiler you can use @SuppressWarnings("all") before the method name!
 * TODO if you get this error "usage of api documented as @since 1.6+" you should go to File > Project Structure > Modules and make sure you have the Language level >= 1.6!
 * TODO you should expose as <code>public</code> only the methods that you usually use over a collection!
 * TODO if you need a getter/setter for the properties you must define then, but keep in mind the java concepts!
 * TODO make sure you cover all the possible use-cases for your data structure!
